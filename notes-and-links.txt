Modules do not use local variable definitions (i.e. terraform.tfvars)!  I copied the file from the module to my terraform scripts.
Nope... that doesn't work either.  Looks like the variables are not being defined.  Do I also need the variables file?

Need the variables file AND assign the variables to module variables in the main.module section.  I think that is correct.

select
node_id,
address,
advertise_address,
sql_address,
advertise_sql_address,
locality,
server_version,
build_tag,
started_at,
is_live,
ranges,
leases
from crdb_internal.gossip_nodes;
